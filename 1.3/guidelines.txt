Article Guidelines
##################

* Articles should be submitted in ReST (ReStructured Text) format â€” easy to
  write, easy to process, and easy for Django to incorporate into the
  Django documentation. There's a sample file called "ARTICLE_SKELETON.rst"
  in this directory which shows off our preferred formatting conventions.
  If ReST is a problem for you, don't worry. Ultimately, any article format
  you choose to submit is OK.

* Each article will be accompanied by a roughly 100-word bio, photo,
  and URL. Please send us your favorite headshot in addition to your bio
  when you submit your article. URLs in the bio are welcome; please keep
  it tasteful and remember that this resource may be around awhile. It's
  ok (and encouraged!) to promote yourself, your company, and your cool
  projects in your bio.
  
  If you already submitted your bio / headshot last year and don't want to
  update it, that's fine.

* If you plan to include some interesting media with your article,
  please get in touch with us so we can work out a solution. Large
  images, many images, or non-image media qualify as "interesting".

Thanks!
