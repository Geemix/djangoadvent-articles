Contributing To Django: A Guide In Verse
========================================

Now Advent can write about many things;
of views based on classes, and ponies with wings.
However, today, we'll tell you about
how Django is powered by people throughout.

The centre of Django is the aptly-named core,
a small group of people, each year they grow more.
Their job is to guide, debate and commit
but all by themselves, there's lots they'd omit.

Django has bugs, and features, and errors,
and sometimes those reports are virtually mirrors
of things in the past that were previously fixed,
or possibly those where the meaning was mixed.

People go through them and sort them all out,
triagers, they're called, and we can't do without
the organisation that they bring to the table;
getting bugs all right the first time is a fable.

However, those tickets are a useful Trac part,
without them we just wouldn't know where to start!
So please, submit tickets, even if they are terse -
just make sure you look for some duplicates first.

A ticket is still a long way from a fix;
there are some more things we must add to the mix.
The first and the biggest is the patch for the code;
without that, we can't even start down the road.

Patches must still apply to trunk cleanly!
(Fixing them is something that's done quite routinely.)
Also remember, documentation is needed -
without it some future confusion is seeded.

The docs, oh they do really matter to those
who look at the patches, 'cause everyone knows
that without documentation the features are just
going to sit there and shrivel and wither and rust.

But really make sure you remember the tests,
else your code will end up in a terrible mess.
They should fail before and then pass on the 'morrow
when your patch has cured some poor user's great sorrow.

These three things will then get your patch done,
but wait! It still has to pass by just one
committer, who has to make sure it is sane
and when they're happy, commit it to main.

Now, this is for small things, and not bigger features -
those form a whole different set of code creatures.
With these, you must start by discussing with core
the feature, the problems, and possibly more.

This takes part on our mailing list for creation
called django-developers - it's full of oration
on upsides and downside of various schemes,
improvements, cutbacks, and people's own dreams.

To this you must post your full explanation
of what must be done, your idea's gestation
and then the people of that list will debate
and eventually conclude - "It's rubbish!" "It's great!"

If your idea then becomes accepted by all
(or by a majority, no matter how small)
the core and the BDFLs will decree
"It is to be built!" (well, if they agree).

Remember, you have a good chance of success
if you write some code; it helps to express
your intentions, and also, how you propose
to handle the issues these people expose.

And lo, behold, your patch was accepted -
all that effort was not misdirected.
Provided you're in before features are frozen,
the release will include the things you have chosen.

But what of the core, of the power they hold?
They will, in good time, add more to the fold -
from the good patches, and authors, they pick
but never too slowly, and never too quick.

So in conclusion, dear reader, I trust
you've learnt many things, and not only just
how difficult it is to write this in verse
and more, how to do it without being terse.

And if you remember one thing above all,
it should be this - Django may be a sprawl
but we make sure to listen to every idea,
no matter how strange it may first appear.

Yes, some ideas do get quickly rejected,
but some code design is just deeply respected.
But we keep improving, code and docs too,
who could help next? Could it be you?
