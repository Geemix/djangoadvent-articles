Django Pony: A Retrospective
############################

In recent years, we have seen the meteoric rise to fame of Django's mascot, the
much-loved Django Pony; with universal acclaim, she has been a guiding symbol,
uniting Django developers worldwide.

Yet the turbulent history of this well-known figure is relatively unknown; her
past is shrouded in mystery so deep that even our highly underpaid researchers
had trouble unmasking it, even with the help of our anonymous source. [#]_

Django Pony's formative years are the most mysterious of all; there are no
birth records for any member of *Equus Volatilis* from that period; given the
rare breed, this is very odd, even taking the species' magical powers into
consideration.

Indeed, there have been rumours that Django Pony is not all she appears to be;
in a leaked document from late 2008, there are claims that Django Pony is in
fact a mechanically-operated exoskeletal animatronic body - while this may seem
implausible, after extensive research [#]_ we've determined it is indeed
possible, provided you have enough funding, and at least two (but possibly
three) mad scientists.

(Our attempts to replicate the effect with a cat, cardboard tubes, and fake fur
were unsuccessful, although the research department believes this is due to an
insufficient number of captions on the cat [#]_.)

To try and verify this rumour, we sent one of our best researchers undercover
to try and obtain a DNA sample for analysis, during one of Django Pony's few
public appearances. Unfortunately, he returned with only a autographed
hoofprint and a moderately brighter outlook on life; we suspect that Django
Pony must be equipped with a lower-power version of Steve Jobs' Reality
Distortion Field. [#]_

However, while her early years are still mostly unknown, a great deal more is
known about her more recent activities. In 2007, Django Pony moved to
California in search of a new life. With an image that appealed to the younger
generation, she was quickly doing photoshoots for small businesses, and was the
logo for My Little Pony's short-lived "My Little Glue Factory" set.

Unsatisfied with small-time adverts and minor branding, she was looking for a
big break - a major branding opportunity. Luckily, news came through that the
Django community (well known as one of the world's finest social groups) was
holding a conference nearby, and that local speaker Cal Henderson was to give
one of the keynotes.

Cal is, of course, a master of deception and subliminal messaging. In exchange
for a bribe [#]_, he wove the idea of the Django Pony into his presentation,
leaving subtle [#]_ hints everywhere. One man - a certain Bryan Veloso - was
particularly affected by Cal's psychological onslought, and succumbed,
spearheading the overwhelmingly successful appointment of Django Pony as
community mascot.

Drunk with her newfound fame, and pleased at how quickly and easily the
community had succumbed, Django Pony toured the country, meeting Django
developers everywhere, helping with bug reports and code reviews; the effect
was overwhelmingly beneficial, and as the new year came around, a revitalized
and energetic Django community headed for PyCon, led by their new figurehead.

Determined to make her first major public appearance holding the new position
of Django mascot, she arrived in Chicago buoyed by optimism. However, things
quickly turned ugly; a gang of rogue Django developers known only as 'Pinax'
decided to kidnap Django Pony for their own nefarious purposes. Thankfully,
Django Pony managed to escape with only a `minimum of casualties
<http://www.flickr.com/photos/bastispicks/3400633546/>`_. [#]_

Shocked by her hostage experience, Django Pony turned to both `alcohol
<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UT35MQmKCiy9QCnnhsbgIg?feat=directlink>`_
and even `one night stands <http://ponysex.us/>`_ to try and forget the
experience, ending up wandering the streets of Chicago in a drug-induced haze.
Luckily, she was found by a group of core Python contributors, out hunting the
GIL [#]_, and taken back to the hotel.

Both hungover and humbled, Django Pony realised the error of her ways, and
decided to try and help the community, ushering attendees into Django talks,
erasing mentions of Zope and Pylons from the programme, and even making up with
a (now reassembled) `James Tauber
<http://www.flickr.com/photos/bastispicks/3396812647/>`_, as well as many other
Django developers.

She went on to make appearances at EuroDjangoCon 2009 and then DjangoCon 2009,
clearly a reformed character; she was crucial in finally getting Django 1.1 out
the door, even flying down to Australia with a copy of the Trac database,
allowing Russ to finally download more than five tickets an hour over his
cutting-edge Australian internet.

However, there are still many unanswered questions about the Django Pony. How
did she get her name? How do those wings fold away when she's not flying? More
importantly, is there any substance to the rumour that she stole the magic
removed from Django itself four years ago? [#]_

Even with these mysteries, though, we can still conclude that Django Pony has
definitely been of benefit to the Django community; in a year where so many
other technologies were competing, Django has steamed ahead, with new features,
new committers, and new releases, and if Django Pony has anything to do with
it, this coming year will be even better. [#]_

.. [#] He went only by the codename 'Jake Obyan'.
.. [#] We checked it using The Google, and it got lots of hits.
.. [#] Of course, it's a well-known fact that captions slow down cats; they're often employed so a picture can be taken without motion blur.
.. [#] Fortunately, Django Pony's version seems to lack the original's ability to cause mass hysteria and inflate stock prices.
.. [#] The bribe was later confirmed to be approximately three hundred t-shirts.
.. [#] We suspect `this image <http://www.flickr.com/photos/yashh/2835538558/>`_ may contain some kind of hidden message, although our analysts are still working on it.
.. [#] Pinax team members are extremely modular and reuseable; the team was quickly reassembled, although they never did find James' spleen.
.. [#] Guido van Rossum, supreme overlord of Python, has offered a significant prize for anyone who can kill the GIL; nobody has yet succeeded.
.. [#] Simon claims it was out of his sight for only a few minutes; whoever took it was clearly either a professional, or distracted him with a minature zeppelin.
.. [#] Unless Django Pony's `evil twin <http://www.break.com/pictures/going-up-on-the-fridge!1650666.html>`_ has anything to do with it; she's on a personal vendetta against multi-db support. Alex Gaynor will soon be taken into protective custody.
